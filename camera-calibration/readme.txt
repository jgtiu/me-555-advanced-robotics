Generate checkerboard:
I printed out the default A4 checkerboard from [Calibration Checkerboard Collection](https://markhedleyjones.com/projects/calibration-checkerboard-collection), with
- checker size 24 mm
- page width 297 mm
- page height 210 mm
- 10 x 7 vertices
- 11 x 8 squares

Capture multiple pictures of the checkerboard:
I kept my laptop webcam location fixed while I placed the checkerboard on multiple different surfaces. For many photos, I simply held up the checkerboard.
All images are 1920 x 1080 px.

I also used this as reference: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html
